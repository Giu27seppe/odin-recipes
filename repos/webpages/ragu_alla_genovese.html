                Rag첫 alla Genovese, also known simply as Genovese, is a Neapolitan style Rag첫. This kind of sauce is a core element in the Italian Cuisine.
                We don't know why a traditonal sauce of the Neapolitan and Campania area. It could be because its inventor was from the Republic of Genoa, or because its last name was literally <b>Genovese</b>, a really common surname in Napoli

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <p>These are the steps to follow in order to obtain a good Pesto
                    <ol>
                        <li>Step 1
                            <p>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add pancetta and cook until most of the fat is rendered, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Step 2
                            <p>Add beef chuck and 2 teaspoons salt to the pot. Increase the heat to high; cook and stir until browned and any liquid released begins to evaporate, 10 to 15 minutes.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> Step 3
                            <p>
                                Reduce the heat to medium-high. Add cooked pancetta, celery, carrots, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Add white wine, tomato paste, and bay leaf; cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes, scraping up the drippings from the bottom of the pan.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Step 4
                            <p>Add yellow and red onions. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 30 minutes without stirring. After 30 minutes, stir onions and meat until well mixed. Cover again and cook for 30 more minutes.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Step 5
                            <p>Stir, then reduce the heat to low. Keep uncovered and cook, occasionally stirring and skimming off any fat, until beef and onions seem to melt into each other, 8 to 10 hours. If the sauce is reducing too much, add water or broth as needed to maintain a sauce-like consistency.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
